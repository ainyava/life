- Real time strategy and endless games (no closure!)
- the anxiety (specially form MOBA)
- more time less gain!
- play games to have fun not to escape!
- the blame and teamwork (some times no matter how hard you try still you're gona lose)
- some games have a broken conduct summery system and matchmaking
